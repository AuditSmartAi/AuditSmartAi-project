Reentrancy in Solidity refers to a situation where a contract's function can be interrupted and called again before the initial function call completes. This can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities in smart contracts. To prevent reentrancy attacks, developers should follow best practices such as using the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern and implementing appropriate safeguards such as using the "ReentrancyGuard" contract HelloWorld using the "mutex" pattern.
